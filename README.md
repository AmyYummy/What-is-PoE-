What is PoE?--------From <a href="https://baudcom.cn">baudcom</a>
PoE is the abbreviation of Power over Ethernet. It’s a standard that allows Ethernet connections to simultaneously transfer data and power over a single network wire. Electrical current, as well as the data ordinarily carried by an Ethernet cable, goes via the Ethernet cable with PoE enabled devices. Throughout the rest of this article, we’ll talk about how PoE works, what is it used for and what are the advantages of PoE.

How does PoE work?
Ethernet cables are typically built with extra data carrying capacity in mind. Most cables have four pairs of wires, but only use two of them – the exception being Gigabit cable, which uses all four pairs to give larger, quicker data carrying capability.

Most Ethernet cables include spare wiring capacity, which PoE takes advantage of. To make a power circuit, the two pairs of wires that aren’t used for data are employed as conductors. Any Ethernet cable with a Category 5 or higher rating is safe to carry current, and because the data and power are carried on distinct bundles of wire, there is no chance of interference.

PoE requires a device that can be powered by PoE, as well as a specialized PoE router or an ordinary router with an intermediary power switch, in addition to an appropriate Ethernet cable.

Advantages of PoE
Cost Saving: By lowering the time and cost of installing electrical power cabling, Network cables do not require the installation of a certified electrician and can be placed almost anyplace.

Flexibility: Devices like IP cameras and wireless access points can be placed wherever they are needed most, and repositioned easily if necessary, because they are not linked to an electrical outlet.

Safety: The intelligent PoE delivery system is designed to safeguard network equipment from overload, under powering, and wrong installation.

Scalability: PoE makes it simple to add new equipment to a network.
